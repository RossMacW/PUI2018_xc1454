#Here is the homework_1 assigment_1.

**Here is the steps that I followed.**

1. Get into the terminal.

2. Create the folder named PUI2018.

3. Use the statement to build the envionmental variable. But this is for the current sessions only.

```export PUI2018="~/PUI2018"```

Then use the statement and I can see the pull path to the directory print on the terminal.

```echo $PUI2018```

4. Save the envionmental variable permanently.

Use the statement to open the file.

```nano. bashrc```

Then use the statement to add the environment variable and alias.

```export PUI2018="~/PUI2018"```
```alias pui2018="cd PUI2018"```

Now save and quiz the file.

5. Use the statement to read the new version of the file.

```source ~/.bashrc```

6. I type those statements to make sure all the setting is ok.

```
pwd
pui2018
pwd
```

Now my environment is setup!
